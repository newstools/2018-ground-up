 The last of the Hermanus community members arrested during protests in March against a controversial land deal were released on bail of R300 on Wednesday, said community leader Sicelo Gxamesi. Community leaders originally told GroundUp that 69 people had been arrested, but now say 81 people were arrested. GroundUp has received conflicting reports from the community and the police. The national government, provincial government, Overstrand municipality, and the Zwelihle committee are planning to hold a workshop on 5 May to discuss land issues in Hermanus. Community leader Theron Mqhu said Minister of Human Settlements for the Western Cape Bonginkosi Madikizela held a meeting with national government on 17 April. According to Mqhu, Madikizela will return to Zwelihle on 15 May.
