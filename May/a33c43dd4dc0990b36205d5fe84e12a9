 As protests continued over housing in Parkwood on Thursday, provincial and municipal officials met to try to defuse the situation. About 50 protesters were stoning vehicles and burning tyres along Prince George Drive, said City law enforcement spokesperson Wayne Dyason at 1pm. Human Settlements MEC Bonginkosi Madikizela promised residents on Tuesday that he would meet City of Cape Town officials today to find a “lasting solution” to the housing problem after protests started on Sunday. The following day violence erupted after over 100 structures were demolished on vacant land in the area. According to Madikizela’s spokesperson, Nathan Adriaanse, the meeting did take place on Thursday but he was tight-lipped over the outcome. He said a “plan” would be discussed with the Parkwood residents’ leadership. William Akim, ward councillor of Parkwood, said he had not attended the meeting.
