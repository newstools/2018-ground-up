The countrywide bus workers’ strike that started last Wednesday continued on Monday. Bus workers’ salaries are negotiated at the South African Road Passenger Bargaining Council by unions and employer organisations. Negotiations started in January but deadlocked, and on 15 April the unions gave employers notice of their intention to strike. Unions are demanding a 12% increase, while employers are offering 6.7%. Zanele Sabela, a spokesperson for the South African Transport and Allied Workers Union, told GroundUp that negotiations did not go well on Friday and no further negotiations have been arranged yet. Commuters across the country have had to make alternative plans, usually involving taxis, to get to work in the morning and back home in the afternoon. Barry Christianson spoke to and photographed people who work in Sea Point and travel back home to Khayelitsha.
