 On Friday seven people involved in the recent protests for housing in Hermanus were released on bail. Six have had charges against them dropped in the Magistrate’s Court, according to community leader Sicelo Gxamesi. 56 arrested community members will appear in court next week. After protests in late March, 69 people were arrested for looting, public violence, and property damage. Hundreds of people marched from Zwelihle to the Magistrate’s Court on Wednesday to show support for the arrested community members, demanding their release.
