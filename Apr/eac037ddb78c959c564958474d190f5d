 A Uitenhage gogo is dishing out tasty free meals for children and destitute elderly people every day. Sheila Isaacs, 68, who runs Mother’s Gift, says cooking is her passion. She and her five volunteers feed about 100 people daily in KwaNobuhle township in Uitenhage. She comes from Rosedale township to KwaNobuhle to put bread on the people’s tables mahala. “I love seeing people smile after warm meals and drinks.” People of all ages eat at midday and any food left over is shared equally. Isaacs says she gets ingredients from sponsors including the Food Bank, Spar and Pick n Pay. Isaacs operates from the Old Sisonke High School building, which is leased to her by the Eastern Cape Department of Education. “Food is very expensive but I go out of my way to put smiles on peopl ‘s faces, by fundraising for food. People don’t have money to buy food so let’s help them.” “I thank the sponsors whose hands are always ready to give.” Tobeka Vaaltyn, 47, says she heard about Mother’s Gift last month. “We thank her as she dished out pickled fish on Easter weekend and made us part of the holy weekend. I have five children and I came with a skhaftina (lunch box) and brought them mahala meals. This mother’s going to get blessings from God for what she does.” Isaacs says she hoped to expand her work to provide karate, boxing, judo, gardening and knitting programmes through her organisation.
