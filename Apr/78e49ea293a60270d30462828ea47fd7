 Residents of H Section in Ntuzuma, north of Durban, blockaded Thendele Road with burning tyres, branches and rocks Monday to demand speed bumps after several accidents in the area. When GroundUp arrived on the scene on Tuesday morning, Ntuzuma police were monitoring the area. Resident, Skyler Raweni, 21, said residents were often hurt by a speeding vehicle on Thendele Road. “On Saturday a boy was hit by a bus that was trying to avoid a speeding car in this road. That boy was standing on the pavement, yet he was hit by the bus. He lost both his legs and we hear that he is fighting for his life in hospital,” said Raweni. She said that a week ago a woman was killed on the same road in a hit and run. “She was laid to rest at the weekend,” said Raweni. Another resident, Zanele Mhlongo, 35, said learners from Muziwabantu Primary School use the road. “Our kids are at danger of being killed by these speeding cars and that is why we call on government to put up speed humps before we lose more lives,” said Mhlongo. Ward councillor Njabulo Mabanga said he was aware of the residents’ concerns and had been asking the municipality for speed humps since November last year. “They promised that the construction of speed humps was going to start in January,” said Mabanga. KZN police spokeswoman Colonel Thembeka Mbhele said a group of 300 people had blockaded the road with stones, demanding speed bumps. She confirmed that a six-year-old boy had been knocked down by a bus on Saturday. “He was taken to hospital for medical attention. A case of reckless driving and negligence was opened at Ntuzuma police station for investigation,” said Mbhele. By the time of publication, eThekwini Municipality deputy communications manager Mandla Nsele had not responded.
