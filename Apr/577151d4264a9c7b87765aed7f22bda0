Mahikeng, the capital of the North West province has been locked down for the past week. Schools and businesses have been unable to open as protests have turned violent with widespread looting. Residents are demanding the removal of Premier Supra Mahumapelo who they accuse of corruption and of not working to provide basic services to the poor townships surrounding the city centre. Mahumapelo has denied all allegations but the huge protests resulted in President Cyril Ramaphosa cutting short his trip to London so that he could return to meet with various ANC leaders to negotiate a solution. The President has called for calm in the province and says that a decision regarding the issues raised by the protesters will be reached soon.
