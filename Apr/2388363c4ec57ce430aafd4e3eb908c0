Over 4,000 people gathered at the Greenpoint Athletics Stadium for the Cape Town Games for Older Living on Tuesday. All participants have to be 60 years or older. The annual event includes track and field, a duck walk, hula hooping, and many other fun competitions. Fundraising Manager at Cape Peninsula Organisation for the Aged, Hubert Paulse, says the event is important because it promotes “active ageing”. This means getting people to join clubs opposed to “sitting at home” says Paulse. “It’s about promoting quality of life,” he says. This years theme for the event is “Healthy Living and Active Ageing”. The Western Cape Department of Health and The City of Cape Town were also organisers of the event. Watch as participants have a jol to Brenda Fassie’s “Weekend Special”.
