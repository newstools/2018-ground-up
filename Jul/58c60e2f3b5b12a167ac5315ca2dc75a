 Residents in Port Elizabeth are furious after the municipality dug up and then abandoned their roads in November leaving deep trenches and making it difficult for people to access their homes. Residents of Boxongo and Nkewana Streets in Daku, Zwide, say they cannot even park their vehicles at their houses. They say the contractor also damaged the sewer system. Noluthando Samuel said, “The situation becomes worse when it is raining because the trenches get filled up with mud that is mixed with sewage water.” “We wanted our streets to be upgraded … The roads are now worse than they were before the excavation.The trench is very dangerous to children because it is very deep and is always waterlogged,” said Samuel. Noziwe Nqoba, who lives on Boxongo Street, said, “I am always in my house. Our children have no place to play … They never explained to us why they left the place unfinished.” “Even the police cannot drive their vehicles here,” said another resident, who didn’t want to be named. Spokesperson for Nelson Mandela Bay Municipality Mthubanzi Mniki said the contractor did not abandon the project. “The contractor is still on site. The place has not been abandoned. The municipality will immediately communicate with the contractor on site for necessary access arrangements to be made … The Community Liaison Officer will also be mandated to consult with the affected residents to make sure that their needs are considered.“
