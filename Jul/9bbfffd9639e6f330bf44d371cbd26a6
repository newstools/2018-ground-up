A number of streets were blocked with rubble and burning tyres in Zwelihle and Mount Pleasant. Sections of the Walker Bay recycling plant and the public pool complex were burnt. Law enforcement used teargas, stun grenades and rubber bullets throughout the day to disperse protesters. The demonstrators used wooden panels and congregated iron sheets as shields. From a nearby hill, protesters hurled rocks, shot marbles with catapults, and hit golf balls with golf clubs at the police. One protester had made a bow and arrow. A video posted by TimesLive shows a police officer being robbed of his gun. Protesters refused to speak to the media.  Protesters ran as police fired rubber bullets.
