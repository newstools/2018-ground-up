Friday is Eid, the holiday that celebrates the end of the month of Ramadan, during which Muslims across the world fast every day from dawn to dusk. At the end of each fast day, families get together for Boeka, when the fast is broken and people recite evening prayers. Photographer Barry Christianson took photographs of Ramadan traditions in Cape Town. “I wanted to find out what it was that was that Muslims in Cape Town were expressing through their observance of Ramadan,” says Christianson. “These are a few visual reflections on Ramadan through the eyes of an outsider.”  A man reads the Quran in the first mosque established in South Africa, the Auwal Masijid on Dorp Street.
